Project description: This is an implementation of C code and ARM assembly to build a simple game that will teach a player Morse Code. The player will interact with the game by pressing the GP21 button on the MAKER-PI-PICO board for a short duration to input a Morse “dot” and a longer duration to input a Morse “dash”. The game will have a minumum of two levels with varrying difficulty with the RGB LED updating from green to red to illustrate the players lives and blue to indicate when the game is not in progress. When the game starts, the player will be presented with an alphanumeric character(A-Z/0-9) where the player should attempt to enter the equivalent Morse code using the GP21 button.
